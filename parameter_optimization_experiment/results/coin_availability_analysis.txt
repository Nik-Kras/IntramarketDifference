CRYPTOCURRENCY DATA AVAILABILITY ANALYSIS SUMMARY
================================================

OVERVIEW:
- Total unique coins in dataset: 293
- Peak availability (Jan 2024): 293 coins
- Final availability (Aug 2025): 281 coins
- Coins ending early: 12
- Net drop in 2025: 12 coins

GROWTH TRAJECTORY:
- 2018 start: 5 coins
- 2024 peak: 293 coins  
- 2025 end: 281 coins
- Overall growth: 56.2x over 7 years

REASON FOR 2025 DROP:
The decrease from 293 to 281 coins in 2025 is NOT due to In-Sample vs Out-of-Sample comparison.
Instead, it reflects the actual data availability cutoff in the Out-of-Sample files.

ANALYSIS METHOD:
1. Script combines both In-Sample (2018-2023) and Out-of-Sample (2024-2025) data
2. For each coin, finds earliest date from either dataset
3. For each coin, finds latest date from either dataset  
4. Monthly coin count = coins with data spanning that month

COINS ENDING BEFORE AUG 2025:

Coins with data ending before August 2025:
- BAL: ends 2024-12-31 (212 days short)
- TROY: ends 2024-12-31 (212 days short)
- KMD: ends 2024-12-31 (212 days short)
- EOS: ends 2024-12-31 (212 days short)
- HARD: ends 2024-12-31 (212 days short)
- WING: ends 2024-12-31 (212 days short)
- LTO: ends 2024-12-31 (212 days short)
- FIRO: ends 2024-12-31 (212 days short)
- CTXC: ends 2024-12-31 (212 days short)
- STPT: ends 2024-12-31 (212 days short)
- NULS: ends 2024-12-31 (212 days short)
- LOKA: ends 2025-07-10 (21 days short)

CUTOFF PATTERNS:
- Earliest data cutoff: 2024-12-31
- Latest data cutoff: 2025-07-10
- Cutoff period span: 190 days

DATA COMPLETENESS:
- Coins with full data through Aug 2025: 281 (95.9%)
- Coins with partial 2025 data: 12 (4.1%)

INTERPRETATION:
The 2025 coin count drop represents natural data availability limits in the source dataset,
not a methodological artifact. Some coins simply have data that ends before August 2025,
likely due to data collection cutoffs or exchange delisting.
